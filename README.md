## About The Project

Problem - we are not able to assess which video a given user should watch, based on the collection of videos and user ratings.

This is a simple movie suggestion engine processes the data.csv file and then informs the user what 5 movies he should watch.
Each movie is rated by the users and the engine suggests the user to watch the movies that they may like.
